# Thailand Election'62 Zone and Candidate Dataset and Browsing Website

![](screenshots/front-pages.png)

## How did we get candidate data?
In the beginning, we had only [PDFs](https://www.ect.go.th/ect_th/news_all.php?cid=165) from The Election Commission of Thailand (ECT). So, we had to parse them manually.
Details about parsing can be founded in `./notebooks/dev.ipyndb`. The process caused several issues, for example, typos from tone marks not ordered properly.

Around 20 Feb 2019, ECT released [SmartVote][smartvote] application, we then tracked down APIs that the application uses and were able to retreive the candidate and party information. 

Below are the datasets extracted from SmartVote's APIs.
1. Zone candidate information 
   ```./data/candidates.csv, ./data/detailed-candidates.csv```
2. Party-list candidate information
   ```./data/partylist_candidates.csv``` with help from by (@c4n)[//github.com/c4n]
3. Party information, including leader and secretary's names, address, logo, address, policy 
   ```/data/party-information.json, ./data/party-logos```

Details about tracking down API endpoints used by SmartVote will be written in TODO.

## Zone & Candidate Browsering Website
This website has two components, first page and zone pages. The first page has a form entering a postcode. We use React for HTML DOM manipulation. On the other hand, zone pages are just static files that are generated accordingly. Please see `generate-site.py` for more details.

### Development
Every change made to those pagaes, located in `election62`, requires a regeneration. One can use the following command to automatically update the site:
```
watch -n 10 'python generate-site.py --env dev'
```

Because the final web will be generated to `./dist`,  you can run a static web server from the root directory and access it via `http://<HOSTNAME>:<POST>/dist`. You might encouter cross-origin issues. If that the case, please check `deploy_path` in `generate-site.py`.

```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```
